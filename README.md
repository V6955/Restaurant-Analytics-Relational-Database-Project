# Restaurant-Analytics-Relational-Database-Project
Our project uses the Restaurant Dataset obtained from Kaggle, which categorizes restaurants by attributes including cuisine type, location, cost, and customer ratings. The dataset contains one row per restaurant, enabling analysis of cuisine distribution and restaurant characteristics across different cities and countries. As stated in our original proposal, the objective of the database is to classify and analyze restaurants based on attributes such as name, location, cost, ratings, and the types of cuisines offered. We are building a relational database designed to support restaurant search, comparison, and recommendation. The database focuses on entities such as restaurants, country, city, locality, cuisine, and rating information, aligning with the schema outlined in the proposal. The primary objective of our database is to provide structured access to restaurant data so that users can: identify popular or highly rated restaurants by city or cuisine, compare restaurant pricing across geographic areas, explore food trends based on aggregated rating, cost, and cuisine availability, and support potential recommendation and decision-making use cases, including budget-friendly dining and cuisine discovery. We anticipate that our database will be useful to customers, restaurant owners, researchers, and food industry analysts, consistent with our stated target audience.

Not many things have changed since the original proposal. I am sticking to the original concept of restaurants and keeping the scope of the project centered around the variables that differentiate restaurants, such as cuisine, location, and cost. I have not decided to change any of the entities or attributes compared to those listed in the proposal. While I have brainstormed ways to improve the proposal, I have not introduced new research questions because I am satisfied with the current focus and would rather explore the existing questions more deeply. In conversations with my mentor, the feedback has been positive, and I plan to continue in this direction. One issue with the proposal was the lack of citations, which I will correct in the next version. Otherwise, I am content with the scope and focus of the project.

For this progress report, I completed all aspects of the work independently. I wrote the entire written progress report, designed the ERD, worked with the Excel dataset, restructured all tables to match the schema, completed the database export file, and revised the schemas as needed to accommodate the data. Overall, I successfully managed and completed each component of the project and am confident in the progress made so far.
